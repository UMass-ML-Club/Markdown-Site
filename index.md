## Our Officers:

**Social Media Manager: `NATHAN WOLF`**

Nathan Wolf is the one making this website, a duty that grants him absolute power to determine what is truth and what is fiction. Nathan recently turned 273 years old. Despite his liver having long crumbled into dust, as well as his severely shrunken heart, he was allowed to fly on the first 100 apollo missions. He even stopped Apollo 11 from exploding midflight ~~after he wanted to smoke onboard~~! He has known since the days of Charles Babbage that he was destined to be the one to set the human race free of its mortal coil through the creation of the AI singularity, an opinion that was confirmed several years ago in a visit from the frog-mother during an ayahuasca excursion gone bad. You can reach him at... actually, you can't.
