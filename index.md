## Our Officers:

**Social Media Manager: `NATHAN WOLF`**

Nathan Wolf is the one making this website, a duty that grants him absolute power to determine what is truth and what is fiction. Nathan recently turned 273 years old. Despite his liver having long crumbled into dust, as well as his severely shrunken heart, he was allowed to fly on the first 100 apollo missions. He even stopped Apollo 11 from exploding midflight ~~after he wanted to smoke onboard~~! He has known since the days of Charles Babbage that he was destined to be the one to set the human race free of its mortal coil through the creation of the AI singularity, an opinion that was confirmed several years ago in a visit from the frog-mother during an ayahuasca excursion gone bad. You can reach him at... actually, you can't.

**President: `RYAN BAHLOUS-BOLDI`** 

[Homepage](https://ryanboldi.github.io/)

Hi! I'm Ryan, a Junior Computer Science student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, pursuing minors in Philosophy and Psychology. I have grown particularly interested in studying human intelligence through the lens of evolving and learning autonomous systems. I am actively conducting research in the areas of evolutionary computation and reinforcement learning. 


**Vice-President: `AAADAM LOKHANDWALA`**

**Lecturer: `KARTHIK SHANKAR`**

Hello! I'm Karthik, and I love to code and create new things! I've dabbled in Machine Learning recently through Image Classification, created many of my own websites using Next.js, went to NECCDC for a cybersecurity competition, and I dabble in a few hobbies that aren't coding from time to time.
